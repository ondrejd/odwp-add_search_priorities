# Customize search results order

_ÄŒeskou verzi najdete zde [README.cs.md][4]._

[WordPress][1] plugin which customizes order of search results by additional priority value. It supports plain [WordPress][1] as well as plugin [Relevanssi][2].

The main part of the plugin is new administration page (__Admin__ -> __Tools__ -> __Search priorities__) where you can set priority to single pages or posts. Items with higher priority will be shown on top of search results listing.

Screencast with usage of the plugin can be found in [this post][5] on my blog.
